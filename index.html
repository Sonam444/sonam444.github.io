            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="color: #f1c40f;" class="glow-text">Hello, I'm Tamang Sonam, a 21-year-old Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) student originally from Kathmandu, Nepal. From a young age, I've been fascinated by technology and its potential to transform lives.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #e74c3c;" class="glow-text">My journey into the world of programming began in high school, where I discovered my passion for coding. I was always intrigued by the idea of becoming a programmer and creating innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #9b59b6;" class="glow-text"><u style="color: #139259;">During my academic journey, I had the privilege of being mentored by Professor Benjamin Slater, who played a pivotal role in shaping my career path. Professor Slater's guidance and encouragement motivated me to pursue web development as a specialization.</u></p>
            
            <p style="color: #f1c40f;" class="glow-text">Under his mentorship, I delved into the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, mastering the fundamental building blocks of web development. His hands-on approach to teaching and unwavering support provided me with the confidence and skills needed to excel in this field.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #e74c3c;" class="glow-text">Today, as a programmer and web developer, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to create impactful solutions and enhance user experiences. I'm committed to continuous learning and growth, always eager to explore new technologies and expand my skill set.</p>
            
            <p style="color: #9b59b6;" class="glow-text">In conclusion, my journey from Kathmandu to pursuing a Bachelor's degree in IT at Ulsan College of Korea has been marked by determination, perseverance, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. I'm grateful for the opportunities and mentorship that have shaped me into the programmer I am today.</p>
